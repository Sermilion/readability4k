  <p>Fallout 4 fans, here is something for you today. Modders ‘Tenhats’ and ‘Shreddah4’ have released a new huge DLC-sized fan expansion for Fallout 4, called Misery Island – Isles Of New England. This is a must-have for all Fallout 4 fans. So, let’s take a closer look at it.<span id="more-191507"></span></p>
  <p>This new DLC-sized Mod adds a detailed new worldspace with 2 fully functional settlements, 20+ locations, 8 interior cells and many small points of interest hidden across the map. The modders have filled the world with custom Weapons, Armors, Clothing, Food, Junk and more.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, players will find a brand new Radio Station, as well as a new custom Pipboy Map. There is also a vast Random Encounter system that includes both vanilla random encounters and brand new ones.</p>
  <p>And that’s not all. The mod packs some game mechanics from older Fallout games. For instance, it has skill checks and weapon schematics. There is also a series of Lore Friendly Quests with optional side objectives and custom quest icon animations. Plus, you’ll find a new weather climate that features a blend of custom weathers alongside Far Harbor and Commonwealth weathers.</p>
  <p>As I said, this is a must-have fan expansion for all Fallout 4 fans. You can go ahead and download it from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/87983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>. At the end of the article, you can also find its official trailer.</p>

Before creating DSOGaming, John worked on numerous gaming websites. While he is a die-hard PC gamer, his gaming roots can be found on consoles. John loved – and still does – the 16-bit consoles, and considers SNES to be one of the best consoles. Still, the PC platform won him over consoles. That was mainly due to 3DFX and its iconic dedicated 3D accelerator graphics card, Voodoo 2. John has also written a higher degree thesis on the “The Evolution of PC graphics cards.”
